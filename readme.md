## ðŸš«ðŸ“§Spam Email Classification

A production-ready Spam Email Classification project with a modular codebase (ingestion â†’ preprocessing â†’ features â†’ training â†’ evaluation), Jupyter notebooks for EDA and clearance steps, logging & reports, and reproducible pipeline orchestration using DVC.

## ðŸ“ŒProject Summary

This repository implements a full ML workflow to detect spam emails.
It includes data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, experiment tracking (via DVC), and generated logs/reports for audits and review.

.....................

Primary goals:
- Reproducible pipeline for spam detection
- Clear separation of steps (each stage is a separate file/module)
- Experiment tracking and remote storage using DVC
- Easy-to-run notebooks for EDA / clearance / demos
